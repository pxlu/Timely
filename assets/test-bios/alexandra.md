Alexandra's is a first-year university student. She recently left Ottawa to pursue her post-secondary education at the University of Toronto. Alexandra has not been feeling well ever since she left her home. She experiences homesickness that overwhelms her with stress, more stress, feeling stressed, incredible stress, anxiety, low energy, and lack of motivation. By the middle of the second semester, she noticed that she started to isolate herself in her room, no longer interacting with her peers at school. After several attempts, her friend was finally successful in persuading her to seek for help at the Health & Wellness Centre (H&W) in late March. However, Alexandra felt very frustrated and stressed over the course of the triage process, since she had to repeat her story and answer similar questions in each of her encounter with staff in the clinic. In April, she was assessed by a GP and a triage nurse, who mutually decided to put her onto the waitlist for one-on-one psychological therapy. Alexandra was told that she would be informed as an appointment becomes available for her. Yet, she has not heard from H&W since then. It is now mid June, and Alexandra is losing hope. She feels helpless, and does not know what she can do to help her mental condition.
